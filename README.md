2. What is the correlation between Japan’s motor vehicle and motorcycle production/export data and its overall economic performance? How do these industries contribute to Japan’s GDP?
3. How have major global events (e.g., economic crises, pandemics, trade agreements) influenced Japan’s motor vehicle and motorcycle production and export trends?
