### Motivating Research Questions
1. How have the production and export trends of motor vehicles and motorcycles in Japan evolved from 1993 to 2024? Are there any noticeable patterns or significant changes during this period?
2. What is the correlation between Japan’s motor vehicle and motorcycle production/export data and its overall economic performance? How do these industries contribute to Japan’s GDP?
3. How have major global events (e.g., economic crises, pandemics, trade agreements) influenced Japan’s motor vehicle and motorcycle production and export trends?
